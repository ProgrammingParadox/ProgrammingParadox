I exist.

Or do I?

I think I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. I'm dabbling in Rust and a few other programming languages.

#### Things I'd like to do:
- Throw together a website
- World domination
- Write a better to do list

#### Programming experience:
Been programming for ~10 years. Still have a lot to learn-- any advice at all would be very appreciated.
