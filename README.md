I exist.

Or do I?

I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. I'm dabbling in Rust and a few other programming languages.

#### Things I'd like to do:
- Create a parser (Then a programming language!)
- Learn Rust
- Throw together a website

#### Programming experience:
Been programming for ~7 years!

(hwæþere/hwathere is old english for "however")
